And puzzles, puzzles are cool. Identifying, analyzing, and solving them is cool (like node_exporter clogging dbus with the systemd collector, or the \"net_device: waiting for eth0 to become free\" race condition in CentOS 7 and k8s). I\xb4ve worked with orchestrators (Kubernetes, Mesos - DC/OS) and some other technologies in the \"DevOps world\" (Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Etcd, Vault, Consul, Prometheus ecosystem, Grafana, to say some). As for the Dev part, I can manage in bash, python, and go (I'm very rusty in java though). In the Ops world, I've worked with CentOS and Ubuntu, and I like engaging in anything related to networking (iptables, balancers, tcpdumping whenever I can, that's why I did a Ph.D. in Telematics). At the same time, I'm working hard to find my way in the cloud environment (AWS, GCP). But most of all, I see the DevOps culture as helping others. We help each other, we solve problems, we deliver.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt [cLabs](https://clabs.co/), I'm trying to continue learning about Cloud Computing, all things DevOps, cryptocurrencies and blockchain.\n\n# Some history\n\n- Attended San Agust\xedn school in Valladolid, Spain.\n\n- Studied Telecommunications Engineering at the University of Valladolid, Spain.\n\n- Went to write my Master's thesis to NTNU, in Trondheim, Norway, as an Erasmus student.\n\n- Remained in Trondheim to pursue my Ph.D. in Telematics.\n\n- Went back to Spain, settled in Madrid, and started working in the DevOps world.\n\n# I like\n\n- Technology\n- Linux\n- DevOps\n- Reading\n- Philosophy\n- History\n- Ancient Rome\n- Greek Mythology\n- Judge Dredd\n- Whisky\n- Beers with my friends\n- Travelling to visit people, NOT to see things\n",d=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(i.jsx)(s.b,Object(o.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(i.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about \xc1lvaro Fern\xe1ndez",children:Object(i.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(i.jsx)("header",{children:Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(i.jsx)(s.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(i.jsx)(r.a,{source:c,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
