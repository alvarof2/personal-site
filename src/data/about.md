# Intro

Curious, eager to learn, and passionate about the DevOps world (culture, movement, practice, or however it is called these days), although I am much more inclined towards the Ops than the Dev part. And puzzles, puzzles are cool. Identifying, analyzing, and solving them is cool (like node_exporter clogging dbus with the systemd collector, or the "net_device: waiting for eth0 to become free" race condition in CentOS 7 and k8s). I´ve worked with orchestrators (Kubernetes, Mesos - DC/OS) and some other technologies in the "DevOps world" (Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Etcd, Vault, Consul, Prometheus ecosystem, Grafana, to say some). As for the Dev part, I can manage in bash, python, and go (I'm very rusty in java though). In the Ops world, I've worked with CentOS and Ubuntu, and I like engaging in anything related to networking (iptables, balancers, tcpdumping whenever I can, that's why I did a Ph.D. in Telematics). At the same time, I'm working hard to find my way in the cloud environment (AWS, GCP). But most of all, I see a DevOps position as helping others. We help each other, we solve problems, we deliver.
